                <p>Vets recommend various types of blood tests for pets to detect different types of ailments and 
                  chronic medical conditions. They may also want such tests to be carried out to fathom the potential 
                  health risks faced by your pet.</p>
                <p>By carrying out blood tests, precise detection of any disorder or infection in the pet is possible. 
                  The blood tests show if the pet is coping with any nutritional deficit as well. Some ailments specific 
                  to the pets can be hard to detect without blood tests as the pets show no physical symptoms. In dogs, 
                  such tests are necessary to detect Lyme disease and heartworm, while Blood tests for cats help detect 
                  the onset of serious ailments like leptospirosis and reveal signs of FIV.

            showing external symptoms. Without carrying out pathology tests, you will not be able to know that the pet has developed a 
            condition in some cases.
